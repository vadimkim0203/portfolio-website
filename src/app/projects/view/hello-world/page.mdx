# Welcome to My Personal Tech Space

My name is **Azat Azamat**, and I'm a developer with a deep interest in **artificial intelligence**, **computer vision**, and anything that involves building something useful (or just fun) with code. I created this website to document my journey as a developer, share the projects I’m working on, and write about the things I’m learning along the way.

---

## Why This Blog?

As someone who’s constantly experimenting with new ideas - whether it's training deep learning models, building AI-powered applications, or exploring backend performance tricks - I’ve always wanted a space where I could **share the process**, not just the results.

> Think of this blog as my _digital lab notebook_: raw, practical, and always evolving.

Whether it’s:

- Breaking down how I trained a custom model to recognize and track players in a soccer match  
- Explaining how I built a backend with FastAPI, Docker, and PostgreSQL  
- Or even writing about weird bugs and how I fixed them at 2 AM

... it’s all part of the journey.

## What’s Next?

Nobody knows... but I hope you'll find something here that helps or inspires you.

Stay tuned, and feel free to reach out or connect if you're working on similar things!
